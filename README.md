## UI/UX Design Planning

**Design Goals:**
* Create intuitive booking flow
* Maintain visual consistency
* Ensure fast loading times
* Prioritize mobile responsiveness

**Key Features (UI/UX Perspective):**
* Property search and filtering
* Detailed property viewing
* Secure checkout process
* User authentication

**Primary Pages:**

| Page                  | Description                                            |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filters      |
| Listing Detailed View | Complete property details with images and booking form |
| Simple Checkout View  | Streamlined payment and booking confirmation           |

**Importance of User-Friendly Design:**
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, increases conversion rates, and improves customer satisfaction. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive design are critical for success.

### Figma Design Specifications

**Color Styles:**
* Primary: `#FF5A5F`
* Secondary: `#008489`
* Background: `#FFFFFF`
* Text: `#222222`
* Secondary Text: `#717171`

**Typography:**
* Primary Font: Circular, Medium (500), 16px
* Headings: Circular, Bold (700), 24px-32px
* Secondary Text: Circular, Book (400), 14px

**Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mockup Design:**
Identifying design properties of a mockup design is crucial for ensuring consistency, accuracy, and efficiency in the development process. It allows developers to translate the visual design into code precisely, maintain brand identity, and create a cohesive user experience. It also streamlines communication between designers and developers by providing clear specifications.
